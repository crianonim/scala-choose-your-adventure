You are an underwater explorer. You are leaving to explore the deepest oceans. You must find
the lost city of Atlantis. This is your most challenging assignment.
It is morning and the sun pushes up on the
horizon. The sea is calm. You climb into the narrow pilot's compartment of the underwater vessel
Seeker with your special gear. The crew of the
research vessel Maray screws down the hatch
clamps. Now begins the plunge into the depths of
the ocean. The Seeker crew begins lowering by a
strong, but thin cable. Within minutes, you are so
deep in the ocean that little light filters down to
you. The silence is eerie as the Seeker slips deeper
and deeper. You peer out the thick glass porthole
and see fish drifting past, sometimes stopping to
look at you—an intruder from another world.
Now the cable attaching you to Maray is extended almost to its limit. You have come to rest on
a ledge near the canyon in the ocean floor that
supposedly leads to the lost city of Atlantis.
You have a special sea suit that will protect you
from the intense pressure of the deep if you choose
to walk about on the sea bottom. You can cut
loose from the cable if you wish because the
Seeker is self-propelled. You are now in another
world.
- explore the ledge where the Seeker has come to rest [] -> #p6
- cut loose from the Maray and dive with the Seeker into the canyon in the ocean floor [] -> #p5

#p5
You radio a status report to the Moray and tell
them that you are going to cast off from the line
and descend under your own power. Your plan is
approved and you cast off your line. Now you are
on your own. The Seeker slips noiselessly into the
undersea canyon.
As you drop into the canyon, you turn on the
Seeker's powerful searchlight. Straight ahead is a
dark wall covered with a strange type of barnacle
growth. To the left (port) side you see what ap-
pears to be a grotto. The entrance is perfectly
round, as if it had been cut by human hands.
Lantern fish give off a pale, greenish light. To the
right (starboard) side of the Seeker you see bub-
bles rising steadily from the floor of the canyon.
- investigate the bubbles [] -> #p8
- investigate the grotto with the round entrance [] -> #p9

#p6
Your sea suit will protect you from the intense
pressures of the deep. It is a tight fit and takes you
some time to put it on. Finally you slip from the
airlock of the Seeker and stand on the ocean floor.
It is a strange and marvelous world where your
every move is slowed down. You begin to explore
with your special hand-held searchlight. You
examine the ledge by the canyon.
Suddenly, a school of bright yellow angel fish
dart by, almost brushing you. What made them
move so fast? Are they being chased?
Then you see it. The Seeker is in the grips of a
huge sea monster. It is similar to a squid, but it is
enormous. The Seeker is just a toy in its long,
powerful tentacles. You seek shelter behind a rock
formation. You know the spear gun you carry will
be useless against this monster. It looks as though it
will destroy the Seeker. Fish of all sizes huddle with
you in an attempt to escape the monster.
- stay hidden close to the Seeker [] -> #p10
- try to escape in the hope that rescuers will see you [] -> #p12

#p8
Carefully, you maneuver the Seeker between
the walls of the canyon.
On the floor of the canyon, you discover a large
round hole out of which flow the large bubbles.
The Seeker is equipped with scientific equipment
to analyze the bubbles. It also has sonar equip-
ment that can measure the depth of any hole.
- analyze the bubbles [] -> #p11
- take sonar readings [] -> #p15

#p9
You pilot the Seeker through the rounded en-
trance to the grotto. Once inside, your searchlight
picks up what appear to be docks and piers along
the grotto walls. The Seeker's searchlight is not
very powerful. However, you do have a special
laser light which would light up the grotto like
daylight. Unfortunately, the laser light can only be
used twice for very short periods before it must be
recharged aboard the Maray, now more than
2,000 feet above you on the surface.
- use the laser light [] -> #p16
- cruise further into the grotto [] -> #p14

#p10
The giant squid tosses and turns the Seeker, but
finally the creature grows tired of its new game and
jets off with an enormous squirt of water. You now
are free to leave your hiding place and examine
the Seeker for damage.
To your dismay, the airlock entrance has been
jammed shut. You are locked out of the Seeker.
The crew of the Maray, however, suspected trou-
ble when you did not respond to a routine radio
check and they are now lowering an escape plat-
form to you. Once on the platform, you radio them
to start the slow pull to the surface. To avoid the
bends—rapid expansion of nitrogen bubbles in
your blood—they will have to bring you up very
slowly.
Just as the platform begins to move, the giant
squid suddenly returns as if from nowhere. It is
headed directly at you.
- fight the squid with your spear gun, hoping to scare it off [] -> #p17
- signal Maray to pull you up at top speed, knowing you will get the bends [] -> #p18

#p11
You squeeze into your sea suit and, outside the
Seeker, you use special equipment to analyze the
bubbles. As you work, you clumsily knock against
the valve that dumps the compressed air necessary
to make the Seeker rise to the surface. There is
nothing to be done about it; so you continue to
analyze the bubbles. They contain a high percent-
age of oxygen and no poisonous gases. Perhaps
they are coming from some area below the sea
where human-type beings can live and breathe.
Perhaps they are coming from Atlantis.
You wonder whether you should try the
Seeker's drilling arm to enlarge the source of the
bubbles so you can explore it with the Seeker. But
you are also very worried about the Seeker's loss
of rising capability. You might also be able to trap
the bubbles and use them to raise the Seeker.
- collect the bubbles coming from the hole to fill the tanks of the Seeker [] -> #p24
- drill [] -> #p22

#p12
Moving cautiously, you climb up the sides of the
canyon hoping to reach the ocean floor. You leave
the Seeker in the grips of the giant squid. Your plan
is to signal for help with a dye marker that will float
to the surface and make a bright yellow patch in
the water. The crewmen above have been in-
structed to watch for such emergency signals.
They will send help.
Once you reach the ledge above the canyon
and feel slightiy safer, you see the most feared of all
sea creatures— a huge shark. It begins to circle
towards you and you know that you are its target.
You wonder whether you should fire your
emergency propulsion charge that will send you
rapidly to the surface. The shark is fast; he might
catch you anyway. You also know that you will get
the bends from the rapid rise to the surface.
- fire the special propulsion charge to get to the surface [] -> #p21
- wait quietly hoping that the shark will go away [] -> #p19

#p14
You cruise silently into the grotto. Its roof seems
to slope upward and you follow the slope. The
depth finder shows that you are rising quite
rapidly. Perhaps you will reach the surface and
open air. Then the roof of the grotto stops sloping
upward. Before you is a perfectly round metallic
hatch made of a metal that you have never seen
before. With the mechanical arm of the Seeker
you try to open the hatch. It will not open. You
begin to send radio signals at the door hoping to
make contact on the other side.
- blow the hatch open with an explosive charge [] -> #p26
- continue transmitting radio communications through the hatch [] -> #p28

#p15
You maneuver the Seeker next to the hole and
begin to take sonar readings to determine the
depth of the hole. To your amazement, the sonar
readings indicate that the hole is extraordinarily
deep— it might reach the center of the earth!
What lies down there? Where are the bubbles
coming from? Is Atlantis beneath you?
Then you notice a disturbing reading on your
instruments; a mild earthquake has occurred. The
Seeker is not damaged, but the earthquake could
set up a tsunami wave on the surface causing the
Moray to leave for safer areas. It might be danger-
ous not to get back to the surface and leave with
the Moray. On the other hand, you are perhaps on
the verge of one of the world's greatest dis-
coveries.
- descend into the hole [] -> #p23
- return to the surface [] -> #p27

#p16
The beam from the laser light illuminates the
entire grotto. Far back on the floor of the grotto is a
submarine! Cautiously, you maneuver the Seeker
closer. You identify it as the submarine that myste-
riously disappeared in the Bermuda Triangle al-
most a year before. The Bermuda Triangle is more
than 2000 miles away.
The submarine is apparently not damaged, but
it is covered with a slimy algae. Beautiful fish swim
around it as though it is their own special prize.
Then you notice that the main hatch is free of
algae!
- try to enter the submarine [] -> #p29
- ruise on through the grotto [] -> #p31

#p17
With a rush of water, the giant squid attacks you.
Two 20 foot tentacles with their pulsing suction
cups reach out trying to ensnare you. You dive off
the platform and rapidly fire two of your spears.
They strike the squid close to its two monstrous
eyes. But the squid keeps on coming.
One of the tentacles wraps around your diving
helmet and ruptures the seal to your suit. You fire
your last spear hoping to hit the monster in a
vulnerable spot. Water is beginning to trickle into
your suit. You signal the Maray to haul you up
fast— "Emergency Hoist." You must have hit the
squid. It floats away writhing and thrashing. You
think you're about to black out.
You wake up on the deck of the Moray and are
quickly rushed to the decompression chambers to
ward off the effect of the bends. In a few days you
are better and start to worry about diving into the
abyss again.
- quit the expedition now [] -> #p32
- go back down to the deep [] -> #p33

#p18
As they begin the rapid hauling, you lose your
ability to function in the deep. You start to get dizzy
and your arms and legs feel weak. You lose your
hold on the platform and drift in the water
exhausted. Then you see a dolphin heading to-
ward you. You know that these marvelous
mammals sometimes help people in trouble. Will it
help you?
- get help from the dolphin [] -> #p34
- carry on alone swimming to the surface [] -> #p37

#p19
You wait for the shark to go away. But then you
notice other sharks coming to join in the hunt.
They circle you, coming closer and faster each
time. It is too late. There is no escape!
The End
- start again [] -> #start

#p21
You fire the special propulsion charge and zoom
upward through the water, frightening schools of
fish as you go. You become dizzy and lose track of
where you are. The world seems upside down.
The shark is nowhere around, you hope. Then
you break through to the surface floating about a
half mile from the Maray.
The lookouts spot you in the water and quickly
rescue you. Unfortunately, the rapid ascent has
given you a bad case of the bends. It takes a long
time to decompress. And when you are finally all
right, the ship's doctor informs you that your
underwater days are over. Someone else will have
to find Atlantis.
The End
- start again [] -> #start

#p22
As you begin to drill, the stream of bubbles
increases.
The stream of bubbles is strong enough now to
ruffle the surface of the sea. You could try to
surface now and locate the exact position of the
bubble area. Then you could make plans with the
scientists aboard the Moray about what to do next.
But also, you could simply explore the hole with
the Seeker to determine the source of the bubbles
now! There is great risk in entering the hole, but it
could lead to the source of the bubbles and maybe
to Atlantis.
- explore [] -> #p38
- try to surface [] -> #p35

#p23
Now is the time for decision. You check all the
controls of the Seeker, grit your teeth, and push
the control column into the deep dive position.
Down, down you go where no person has ever
ventured. The Seeker is built for deep, deep dives,
but you are descending rapidly mile after mile into
the deep. The pressure is intense, the darkness is
complete, and the depth guage indicates an in-
credible 15 miles. You quickly reverse the control
column. Warning lights flare up on your control
panel; they show that gravitational forces are now
stronger than the Seeker's propulsion motors. You
have passed the point of no return and your jour-
ney downward will continue in utter darkness until
the water pressure is too great for the Seeker. This
is the final voyage.
The End
- start again [] -> #start

#p24
You are able to capture the bubbling gases and
fill the tanks of the Seeker, enough to allow it to
rise. Slowly, the Seeker rises out of the canyon,
scattering schools of brightly colored fish, and
brushing past underwater plants that wave like
palm trees in a wind. Just as you reach the ledge at
the top of the canyon, you see what appears to be
an old road! Rocks along its side seem to be guard
rails. Could this be a path that leads to the lost city
of Atlantis? You anchor the Seeker and prepare to
investigate more closely.
- continue [] -> #p6

#p26
The only way to get beyond the door is to blast it
away, or so you believe. The Seeker's laser can-
non is powerful and you position the Seeker to fire.
Pushing the fire button, you send a powerful beam
at the hatch. Nothing happens. Then you advance
the cannon control to full emergency force. Again
you push the button and the beam dissolves the
hatch instantly. A flood of sea water rushes into the
giant hole, carrying you with it into an air-filled
cavern beyond. The water fills the cavern with
speed and explosive force. You see several people
scurrying towards escape hatches. IT IS TOO
LATE! You did the wrong thing.
The End
- start again [] -> #start

#p27
Deciding to return to the surface, you direct the
Seeker cautiously back along the side of the can-
yon in the ocean floor. Without warning, the
Seeker is gripped in a powerful current that sweeps
it toward a grotto. Once in the grotto, the current
carries you to what appears to be a large metal
door. It swings open and the Seeker is swept in-
side. The door closes, the water in the grotto drains
away, and you step out into a chamber that you
decide must be made by human hands.
A door opens in the wall, two people dressed in
simple clothes come towards you. One of them
says, "Welcome to Atlantis. We have been expect-
ing you."
What a discovery! You have found the lost con-
tinent and its civilization. The two people tell you
that although citizens of Atlantis occasionally jour-
ney to the upper world, anyone who happens
upon Atlantis is never permitted to leave. The
Atlanteans are not cruel but fear discovery of their
world.
They want you to follow them and you agree.
But you have another thought. Perhaps you could
blast your way out of the chamber with the
Seeker's laser cannon.
- follow the people and join the Atlantean society [] -> #p39
- make a dash for the Seeker and try to blast through the closed door with the laser cannon [] -> #p40

#p28
The radio transmissions seem to be failing, and
you grow tired of sending signals through the
closed door. You are just about to give up when
the door suddenly swings open revealing behind it
a cavern with another door. You enter the cavern
cautiously and receive a radio signal in English. It
tells you that you are welcome here, but that once
you enter this place, you may never return to the
world above. It is up to you to decide.
- go on and investigate what might be Atlantis [] -> #p41
- retreat [] -> #p42

#p29
The submarine is indeed mysterious. You now
have on your sea suit and you open the hatch on
the conning tower and enter the sub. It is amaz-
ingly clean and in order. There are no signs of life,
but there are also no signs of struggle or trouble. In
the control room, you see a piece of mystifying
equipment that just doesn't belong on this sub.
A voice begins telling you that, thousands of
years ago, the leaders of Atlantis realized that their
continent was slipping into the sea. They discov-
ered a large underground cavern and built new
forms of living quarters for their people. Later
when Atlantis was deep beneath the ocean, some
of their scientists discovered and perfected an op-
eration enabling them to breathe under water.
The voice, which sounds friendly, also tells you
that there are two groups in Atlantis. One group is
good and the other is evil. The voice invites you to
enter the world of Atlantis and gives directions and
instructions to a secret passageway to the under-
water city.
As you follow directions, you spy an unbeliev-
able underwater craft with several people in it. It
must be an Atlantean ship, but are the people
good or evil? Do they know of the secret passage-
way?
- hurry in, trying to reach the secret passageway without being seen [] -> #p43
- rush back to the Seeker trying to escape danger [] -> #p44

#p31
You cruise through the grotto past the wreck of
the submarine and then you spot another ship
wreck. And then another. They, too, are covered
with algae, but they appear undamaged. Maybe
people from Atlantis capture ships in the Bermuda
Triangle and bring them here. Then you see
another ship, but this one is a three-masted
schooner of the type used in the early 1800s. Its
rigging is festooned with algae, and fish swim lazily
around its mast.
Your curiosity captures you and you put on your
sea suit. Leaving the Seeker, you move towards
the old sailing ship. Suddenly a thirteen-foot long
deadly poisonous sea snake strikes from behind
the forward cabin and bites you in the soft flesh
between the fingers of your right hand. There is no
antidote to the deadly poison.
The End
- start again [] -> #start

#p32
With great sorrow, you decide that it is wisest to
leave the expedition now. You can't risk returning
to the great depths below. So, you reluctantly
return to the United States.
You are invited to tell of your adventures on
several major television shows. While on one such
show, a special news flash announces to the world
the discovery of Atlantis. You regret your decision,
but you didn't really have a choice. Did you?
The End
- start again [] -> #start

#p33
You can't resist the adventure beneath the sea.
You must go down again, and after several weeks
of rest, you enter the Seeker and slip quickly into
the deep. You bring the Seeker to rest by the great
canyon in the ocean bottom and, wearing your
special suit, you venture out into the depths. There
are no signs of the giant squid and you feel safe.
Rounding a rock formation, you come upon the
wreck of an ancient Greek ship. How strange to
find this ship, intact, so far below the surface. What
brought it here? Was it visiting Atlantis before the
lost continent slipped beneath the sea?
You take pictures and make notes in your spe-
cial undersea book. Maybe this ancient ship hides
the secret to Atlantis.
- go aboard the Greek ship [] -> #p45
- return to the surface to report your findings [] -> #p46

#p34
The dolphin looks at you, and you even imagine
that he is smiling at you. You grab one of his
flippers and with a powerful switch of his body, the
dolphin swims upward. In a short time, you break
through to the surface. You blink in the bright sun.
The Maray is nowhere in sight. You are lost far at
sea.
The dolphin dives beneath the surface with you
still clinging to him. He speeds off and within 20
minutes you are next to the Moray. The dolphin
must have heard the Moray's engine noises un-
derneath the water.
Once aboard, everyone congratulates you on
your escape. You will go down again, but the
thought keeps haunting you: What if your luck has
run out?
- dive again the next day [] -> #p48
- give up the expedition [] -> #p47

#p35
You suddenly realize the stream of bubbles is
powerful enough to raise the Seeker. You guide
the Seeker into the bubble stream and it heads
towards the surface. As you swirl upward, you
begin to notice increasing amounts of brown
kelp— seaweed. Near the surface, you become
entangled in the seaweed. The instruments in the
Seeker indicate that the propellers and the steering
mechanisms will not work.
You put on your sea suit and go out to see what
can be done. Once outside in the kelp, you realize
that you can't free the Seeker. You start to swim
for the surface but then you are soon completely
stuck in the clinging seaweed. You are trapped and
unable to go forward or return to the Seeker.
- keep struggling towards the surface [] -> #p50
- rest quietly, gain strength, and work out a plan [] -> #p53

#p37
The dolphin might help and might not. You
decide to chance it alone. So, up you head, swim-
ming towards the surface. The dolphin follows for
some time, and then swims off. You rest for awhile
about 300 feet below the surface before your final
ascent.
Then a large fish— ugly, lumpy, puffed up, and
covered with black and white markings swims to-
wards you. Its bulging eyes fasten on you. It is a
big-mouthed grouper, a fish which does not
bother to bite its victims, but simply swallows them
whole.
It looks as though you are its next meal.
The End
- start again [] -> #start

#p38
You decide to guide the Seeker into the new
passageway to the bubble source. Suddenly the
Seeker is swept downward as if pulled by a giant
magnet. You lose consciousness. When you
awake, you are in a well-lighted and comfortable
room. Three people are standing close to you.
They look normal and appear to be friendly.
The middle one speaks. "You are in the nether
region of Atlantis. This is a visitors' reception room.
If you wish to come into the city of Atlantis, then
follow us; but you may never return to your world.
If you wish to leave now, we will escort you safely
to the surface. It is your choice. We do not wish to
harm you."
- follow them into the city of Atlantis [] -> #p55
- return to the surface [] -> #p51 

#p39
You are led to a room. The floors are a rich
marble. The walls glow. The ceiling is like being
inside a diamond looking through the many facets.
A person who immediately commands respect
beckons you with firmness and kindness to come
to her.
"Welcome to Atlantis. Thousands of years ago
we learned that we were about to slip into the sea.
Our people prepared for the calamity by building a
new city inside an extinct volcano. We have lived
here in peace and harmony ever since. We have
no sunlight, nor stars to gaze at, but we have other
spaces to meditate upon."
She tells you about a group of people called the
Nodoors. If you wish, you can live with them, but
you cannot leave Atlantis.
A bearded man is to be your escort. Atlantis is a
beautiful city. Buildings merge one into another,
colors radiate light, and coral branches fill court-
yards. There is a sense of well-being and peace.
It would be pleasant here, but you don'
t want to
be a prisoner. Maybe there would be a better
chance to escape if you join the Nodoors. You ask
your guide about them.
"Oh, we believe they are dangerous, but we
don'
t really know. They live in the center of the old
volcano. If you wish, I can take you there."
- join the Nodoors [] -> #p56
- remain with the Atlanteans and perhaps get a chance to escape [] -> #p57

#p40
The Atlanteans have lived in peace for thousands
of years. They have no love of warfare. Their
civilization is technologically very advanced and a
sensing mechanism tells them that you are about
to use your laser cannon. They quickly fire a spe-
cial beam at the Seeker that makes all its functions
stop. You are now powerless to escape. They walk
up calmly to the Seeker and tell you to come with
them to Atlantis.
"You are now part of Atlantis. We understand
your fear, but do not be frightened. No harm will
come to you and your life will be full. Follow us."
As you walk with them, into a new world, you
wonder if you will ever see the sky again.
The End
- start again [] -> #start

#p41
You are greeted by a group of people who look
like ordinary human beings except that there are
gill-like slits on their necks. Their bare feet have
skin between the toes forming a web. They order
you to put on your sea suit, pull you quickly from
the Seeker, and lead you towards their city. On the
way they show you the zoo where there are ani-
mals from the world above the sea. There is a
glass-like cage surrounding them filled with air,
allowing them to live below the sea.
The leader of the group explains that if you wish
you may either submit to an operation to have gills
inserted so that you may breathe underwater, or
you may join the other animals in the zoo.
- agree to the operation [] -> #p58
- go to the zoo [] -> #p59

#p42
Back aboard the Seeker, you radio the Maray
that you are surfacing to make a plan. While rising
out of the giant crevice-like canyon, you spot what
appears to be a road running along the top of the
ledge. What is this? The scientists aboard the
Maray had mentioned the possibilities of finding
signs of the ancient civilization, such as roads. You
must investigate.
- continue [] -> #p6

#p43
You escape being seen by the submarine craft.
Following the instructions you enter a passage-
way. At the end of the passageway is an airlock
door and beyond it an incredibly large air-filled
cavern. Perhaps it is the inside of an extinct vol-
cano.
The land is pleasant, although strange to your
experience. A soft substance covers the ground. It
seems to be alive. You can'
t tell. A gentle light
comes from the sides of this huge cavern. It re-
minds you of early morning light just before the
sun rises.
A group of people approach you with friendly
gestures. They are wearing simple clothes much
like the clothes people wore in ancient Greece.
They are kind and generous. You remove your
diving suit to find that the air is good to breathe.
These people speak a language that is unknown
to you, but one of them acts as an interpreter. You
find out that this is Atlantis. They tell you it is
governed by a man who is greedy, selfish, and
dangerous. The people are like slaves. Everyone is
unhappy except a few who serve the ruler as his
lieutenants. These new friends ask for your help.
Perhaps you can help them escape.
- leave your new friends and search for the ruler [] -> #p60
- help your new friends escape [] -> #p61

#p44
Quickly you get into the Seeker in an attempt to
escape the strange submarine. You notice that the
sub is chasing you so you put on full emergency
ascent power. You could use your laser cannon to
blast the sub, but you do not wish to hurt anyone.
The ascent towards the surface is swift, but a few
fathoms from the surface all systems on the Seeker
fail. You are suspended in the water in a helpless
position. It seems that a mysterious force has dis-
abled you.
- wait on board the Seeker for help from the Maray [] -> #p64
- try to escape from the Seeker and try for the surface on your own [] -> #p63
